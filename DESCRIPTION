Description: 
	Fits a state-space mass-balance model for marine ecosystems,
	which implements dynamics derived from 
	'Ecopath with Ecosim' ('EwE') <https://ecopath.org/>
	while fitting to time-series of fishery catch, biomass indices,
	age-composition samples, and weight-at-age data.  
	'Ecostate' fits biological parameters (e.g., equilibrium mass)
	and measurement parameters (e.g., catchability coefficients)
	jointly with residual variation in process errors, and can include
	Bayesian priors for parameters.
