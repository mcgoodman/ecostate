\description{
Plot consumption as a directed graph including all taxa (vertices)
and biomass consumed (arrows).  Taxa are located using tracers,
where by default the y-axis is trophic level.  #'
}
\details{
Trophic level \eqn{l_i} for each predator \eqn{i} is defined as:

\deqn{ \mathbf{l - 1 = l Q^*} }

where \eqn{\mathbf{Q*}} is the proportion consumption for each predator (column)
of different prey (rows).  We identify primary producers as any taxa with no
consumption (a column of 0s), and assign them as the first trophic level.
